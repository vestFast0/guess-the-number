Guess The Number game in all programming languages


## Game Description 
This game is a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. <br>
**Hereâ€™s how it works:** <br>
the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. <br>
It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program <br>
will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game <br>
will print a congratulatory message and exit.
